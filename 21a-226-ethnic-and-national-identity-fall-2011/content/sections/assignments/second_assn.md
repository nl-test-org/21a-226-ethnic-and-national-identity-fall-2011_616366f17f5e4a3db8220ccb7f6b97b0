Choose two or three cases of violent ethnic conflict taking place in the world today, or in very recent history. The cases may be any of the types described in the lectures. Describe the present situation and include relevant history. Describe how your sources (the authors you cite) analyze the causes of the conflicts. Then compare the conflicts. Compare how the authors cited analyze the cases.

You must cite six authors; two may come from class readings.

No judgmental language or opinions of your own (about who is right, more moral, etc.) until the final paragraph.

7 or more pages.
